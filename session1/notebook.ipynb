    "> *Derivatives are at the heart of scientific programming. From the Jacobian matrices used to solve nonlinear systems to the gradient vectors used for optimisation methods, from the backpropagation operation in machine learning to the data assimilation methods used in weather forecasting, all of these techniques rely on derivative information. Differentiable programming (also known as automatic/algorithmic differentiation (AD)) provides a suite of tools for users to compute derivatives of quantities in their code without any manual encoding.*\n",

    "## Preparations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "This course introduces the concept of *differentiable programming*, a.k.a. *automatic differentiation (AD)*, or *algorithmic differentiation*. We will use the acronym AD henceforth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a differentiable *mathematical* function $f:A\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ with scalar input (i.e., a single value) from $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$, we make use of both the Lagrange notation $f'(x)$ and Leibniz notation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ for its derivative.\n",
    "We **do not** use the physics notation for derivatives, so if you ever see (e.g.) $\\dot{x}$ then this is just a variable name, not the derivative of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ dimensional, differentiable, vector-valued function $\\mathbf{f}:A\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^m$ with scalar input, we have derivative notations $\\mathbf{f}'(x)$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{f}}{\\mathrm{d}x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a differentiable function with vector input (i.e., multiple inputs), we use partial derivative notation. For example, if $f:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is written as $f=f(x,y)$ then we have the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ with respect to first and second components, respectively. We use\n",
    "$$\\nabla f=\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1},\\dots,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_m}\\right)$$\n",
    "to denote the vector of all such partial derivatives. Similarly for vector-valued functions with multiple inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to derivatives in code, we use the `_d` notation, which is standard in the AD literature. Its meaning will be described in due course."

    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "* Origins of AD in 1950s.\n",
    "* However, it found a wider audience in the 1980s, when it became more relevant thanks to advances in both computer power and modern programming languages.\n",
    "* Forward mode (the subject of this session) was discovered by Wengert in 1964.\n",
    "* Further developed by Griewank in the late 1980s.\n",

    "## Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of AD is to **treat a model as a sequence of elementary instructions** (e.g., addition, multiplication, exponentiation). Here a *model* could be a function or subroutine, code block, or a whole program. Elementary operations are well-understood and their derivatives are known. As such, the derivative of the whole model may be computed by composing the derivatives of each operation using the *chain rule*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recap on A-level maths: the Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two composable, differentiable (mathematical) functions, $f$ and $g$, with composition $h=f\\circ g$. By definition, this means\n",
    "$$h(x)=(f\\circ g)(x)=g(f(x)).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the *chain rule* states that the derivative of $h$ may be computed in terms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ using the formula\n",
    "$$h'(x)=(f\\circ g)'(x)=(f\\circ g')(x)\\,f'(x)=g'(f(x))\\,f'(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, in Leibniz notation:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}h}{\\mathrm{d}x}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}f}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For variables with multiple arguments, the result is equivalent for each partial derivative, e.g.,\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial f}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}.$$"
