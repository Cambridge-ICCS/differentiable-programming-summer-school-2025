    "# Session 1: Forward mode differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "This course introduces the concept of *differentiable programming*, a.k.a. *automatic differentiation (AD)*, or *algorithmic differentiation*. We will use the acronym AD henceforth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a mathematical function $f:A\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ with scalar input (i.e., a single value) from $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$, we make use of both the Lagrange notation $f'(x)$ and Leibniz notation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x}$.\n",
    "We **do not** use the physics notation for derivatives, so if you ever see (e.g.) $\\dot{x}$ then this is just a variable name, not the derivative of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ dimensional vector-valued function $\\mathbf{f}:A\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^m$ with scalar input, we have derivative notations $\\mathbf{f}'(x)$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{f}}{\\mathrm{d}x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a function with vector input (i.e., multiple inputs), we use partial derivative notation. For example, if $f:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is written as $f=f(x,y)$ then we have the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ with respect to first and second components, respectively. We use\n",
    "$$\\nabla f=\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1},\\dots,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_m}\\right)$$\n",
    "to denote the vector of all such partial derivatives. Similarly for vector-valued functions with multiple inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to derivatives of code, we use the `_d` notation, which is standard in the AD literature. Its meaning will be described in due course."

    "## Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of AD is to **treat a model as a sequence of elementary instructions** (e.g., addition, multiplication, exponentiation). Here a *model* could be a function or subroutine, code block, or a whole program. Elementary operations are well-understood and their derivatives are known. As such, the derivative of the whole model may be computed by composing the derivatives of each operation using the *chain rule*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recap on A-level maths: the Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two composable, differentiable (mathematical) functions, $f$ and $g$, with composition $h=f\\circ g$. By definition, this means\n",
    "$$h(x)=(f\\circ g)(x)=g(f(x)).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the *chain rule* states that the derivative of $h$ may be computed in terms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ using the formula\n",
