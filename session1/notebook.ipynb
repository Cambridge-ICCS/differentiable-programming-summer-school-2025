    "The idea of AD is to **treat a model as a sequence of elementary instructions** (e.g., addition, multiplication, exponentiation). Here a *model* could be a function or subroutine, code block, or a whole program. Elementary operations are well-understood and their derivatives are known. As such, the derivative of the whole model may be computed by composing the derivatives of each operation using the *chain rule*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then the *chain rule* states that the derivative of $h$ may be computed in terms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ using the formula\n",
