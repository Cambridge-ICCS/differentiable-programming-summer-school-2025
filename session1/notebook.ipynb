    "\n",
    "The idea of AD is to **treat a model as a sequence of elementary instructions** (e.g., addition, multiplication, exponentiation). Here a *model* could be a function or subroutine, code block, or a whole program. Elementary operations are well-understood and their derivatives are known. As such, the derivative of the whole model may be computed by composing the derivatives of each operation using the *chain rule*.\n",

    "Consider two composable, differentiable (mathematical) functions, $f$ and $g$, with composition $h=f\\circ g$. By definition, this means\n",
    "$$h(x)=(f\\circ g)(x)=g(f(x)).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the *chain rule* states that the derivative of $h$ may be computed in terms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ using the formula\n",
    "$$h'(x)=(f\\circ g)'(x)=(f'\\circ g)(x)\\,g'(x)=g(f'(x))\\,g'(x).$$"
