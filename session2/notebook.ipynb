    "The *operator overloading* approach is fundamentally different to source transformation. It does not generate additional source files and instead generates derivatives *at runtime*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to record all operations applied to variables involved in the computation so that derivatives can be computed by applying the chain rule to the derivatives of those operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the AD tool, the user experience is something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mark (input) variables to compute derivatives with respect to as *independent*.\n",
    "2. Mark (output) variables to compute derivatives of as *dependent*.\n",
    "3. Call driver methods supported by the AD tool to compute derivatives.\n",

    "The approach fits well with another 'OO': *object orientation*. In classic implementations such as [ADOL-C](https://github.com/coin-or/ADOL-C), basic types are enriched by introducing corresponding structs (derived types in Fortran) that hold both the standard (forward) value and also the gradient. For example,\n",

    "In scientific programming, time-dependent problems are typically solved using a timestepping method such as the theta-method we saw in the first session. When writing code for such methods, it's common practice to overwrite the variable for the approximation at a given timestep as we progress through the steps. In such a formulation, the value is no longer in memory and needs to be recomputed.\n",

    "In some cases, it's possible to keep the full state on the tape at every timestep, whereby all the information required for reverse mode is available - see Figure 4.\n",
